You are asked to design a temperature sensing system to measure environment temperature in a campus laboratory. The system will be driven by a PIC microcontroller which will control the LM35 temperature sensor, and communicate through UART/USART to a host computer for remote data monitoring. The minimum allowed resolution for the system in terms of ADC number of bits is 12. As you are required to reduce the system cost as much as possible, you need to match a microcontroller with features closest to the system requirements.
